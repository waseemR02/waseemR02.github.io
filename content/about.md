Hey, I'm Waseem. I'm interested in:
- Software Engineering (C++, Rust, Python, ...)
- Robotics
- Deep learning
- Embedded Systems Programming
- Computer Vision

I am currently enrolled as a 3rd Year student in SRM Institute of Science and Technology pursuing a B.Tech Degree in Computer Science and Engineering(CSE) with specialization in Cyber Security and will be graduating by 2025. I am interested in coding and hacking and am seeking opportunities to learn the same. I have worked on projects involving robotics, rover, embedded systems, ROS2 and deeplearning. I enjoy understanding what goes on in the hardware and in my spare time I like to read novels.
